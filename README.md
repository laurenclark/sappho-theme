# Sappho Theme 

![logo](https://i.imgur.com/33oB5Jj.png)

A dark theme based on Greek Poet Sappho of Lesbos. 
For women who love women (& code) and people who love purple!

There are many purple themes, which I found to be lacking in contrast
and not optimised for front-end or JavaScript stacks, so here is what I came up with.
